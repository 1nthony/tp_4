In conclusion, we use GGEs as variational states to approximate the steady state of an open quantum system. 
These ensembles are formulated using predefined conserved quantities, and the parameters are their associated Lagrange multipliers.
We have applied these ideas to the damped harmonic oscillator, and in that case the variational method is able to recover the observables of the physical system.

However, the ans√§tze we used were strongly informed by the analytical solution. We aim to broaden the applicability of a viable variational state by expressing the conserved quantities in a more generalized form.
We also expect the method to be efficient in the multi-body case as well, which is the next step of the work.
