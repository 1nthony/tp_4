By considering all conserved quantities, Generalized Gibbs Ensembles (GGEs) effectively characterize the steady state of an open quantum system. We use truncated GGEs as variational states to approximate the steady state of an open quantum system, and we show that in simple single-particle cases we recover the true steady state. We apply our method to a damped harmonic oscillator.
